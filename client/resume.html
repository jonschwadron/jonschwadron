						<li>
							College senior project experience with a team of three. My role was to develop an Android app. The FSC Virtual ID app is a prototype exclusively designed for Farmingdale State College that can be a replacement for a Student ID card. The method was to use a QR code scanner to buy goods or to access dormitories/gym/facilities. The idea was to allow students or staffs to add funds, view balance, view transaction history of recent purchases, view contacts/hours. It includes a pin-unlock screen prior to viewing the QR code. It makes it more secure than using a vulnerable Student ID card.
